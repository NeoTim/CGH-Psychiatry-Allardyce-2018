\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bipolar disorder (BD) overlaps considerably with schizophrenia
              (SCZ) in both its clinical presentation and genetic liability.
        \item Bipolar disorder is a phenomenologically heterogeneous construct.
        \item It has been proposed that
            \begin{itemize}
                \item This clinical heterogeneity indicates underlying etiological heterogeneity.
                \item The degree of clinical similarity between BD and SCZ reflects overlapping alleles.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mood congruence of psychotic features}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Delusions and hallucinations are common in BD
            \begin{itemize}
                \item 1/3 judged to be mood incongruent
            \end{itemize}
        \item Mood-incongruent psychotic features are associated with
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Poor prognosis
                \item Poor lithium response
                \item Qualitatively similar to the prototypic symptoms of SCZ
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    This suggests that BD with psychosis and particularly mood-incongruent
    psychotic features has stronger etiological links to SCZ.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item GWAS have found a substantial polygenic component to both BD and SCZ risks.
        \item This risk can be calculated with the polygenic risk score (PRS).
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Higher scores indicate a higher burden of risk alleles.
            \end{itemize}
        \item The PRS-SCZ differentiates BD cases from controls.
        \item Schizoaffective bipolar disorder (SABD) has a relatively larger burden of SCZ risk, compared with other BD subtypes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hypotheses}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item BD with psychosis would be associated with higher polygenic risk for SCZ.
        \item This association would be stronger when mood-incongruent psychotic features were present.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Sample ascertainment}
\begin{frame}{Bipolar disorder sample}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 4436 cases of bipolar disorder
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Deep phenotypic information
                \item European ancestry and domicile in the United Kingdom
                \item Data collected in 2000--2013
            \end{itemize}
        \item Stratification
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Subtypes in Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC)
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Bipolar I (BD I)
                        \item Bipolar II (BD II)
                        \item Schizoaffective bipolar disorder (SABD)
                    \end{itemize}
                \item Lifetime ever occurrence of psychotic symptoms (LEP)
                \item Level of mood incongruence (LMI)
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    RDC differentiates individuals on the basis of their pattern of mood and
    psychotic symptoms better than DSM-5 and ICD-10.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Schizophrenia sample}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 4976 cases of the CLOZUK study sample
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Treatment-resistant schizophrenia, treated with clozapine
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    In principle, treatment-resistant SCZ may carry higher polygenic risk
    burden; however, the PRSs in the CLOZUK sample are similar to the PRSs in
    other SCZ samples used by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Control samples}
    The controls came from 2 UK sources:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 2532 cases from Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Unscreened
            \end{itemize}
        \item 6480 cases from Generation Scotland
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Screened for psychiatric disorders
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Principal components analysis}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To adjust for potential confounding from population structure, principal components analysis was performed.
        \item The eigenvectors for the first 10 principal components were kept to use as covariates in the association analysis.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Polygenic risk scores}
    PRSs were generated using the 2014 Psychiatric Genomics Consortium SCZ
    meta-analysis as the discovery set.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Statistical analysis}
    A multinomial logit model was used to estimate differential associations of
    standardized PRSs, adjusted for the first 10 principal components and
    genotyping platforms across the categories of cases and controls.
